# Computer Architecture ‚Äî University of Tehran  

This repository contains the **Computer Assignments (CA)** for the University of Tehran *Computer Architecture* course.  
The projects are implemented in **Verilog** and focus on designing, simulating, and understanding computer hardware concepts.  

## üìö Course Assignments  

1. **CA1 ‚Äî Maze Game**  
   - A Verilog-based game simulation demonstrating basic digital design principles and FPGA programming.  

2. **CA2 ‚Äî Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor**  
   - Implementation of a single-cycle RISC-V processor.  
   - Covers instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back stages in a single clock cycle.  

3. **CA3 ‚Äî Multi-Cycle RISC-V Processor**  
   - Multi-cycle RISC-V processor implementation with control and datapath separation.  
   - Improves hardware resource usage by splitting execution into multiple cycles.  

4. **CA4 ‚Äî Pipelined RISC-V Processor**  
   - Fully pipelined RISC-V implementation.  
   - Supports instruction-level parallelism and resolves pipeline hazards.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools  
- **Verilog HDL** (Hardware Description Language)  
- **ModelSim** or **Vivado** for simulation and synthesis  
- RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
